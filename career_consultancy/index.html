              <h1>FROM THE PRINCIPAL’S DESK</h1>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                In a fast changing world where every second has a new development  to share, careers are also taking new dimensions every day. What is trending today becomes obsolete tomorrow and no one has the leisure to stand and think. 
                <br>
                  It is in this context that JNV Panchawati has come out with a platform to discuss career choices, tips to identify one's calling and to think out alternative options if your choice does not take the expected route. Before you decide to 'love what you get', at least explore if there are viable options,  hence the reflections about alternatives.   
                <br>
                    There are a handful of students who always get or grab what they want - these are the toppers. Their vision is clear and they are focussed . 
                 <br>
                  There is a major group who are no less capable,  but are not focussed enough when it comes to picking their choices and careers. They need help, so do even the top graders. 
                 <br>
                  This interface is for all of them. To explore, identify and pick. Not complete by any means, especially with the fast changing trends, requirements and fields, but at least a pointer  that can help you have a broad glimpse of the scenario out there. You may come across something that aligns with your interest, aptitude and orientation, that can be a game changer. 
                 <br>
                  Efforts have been made to explore different aspects of career guidance and counselling. The school career counselling desk will be virtually and actually available to render services to the students of the school. What is more, it is  a platform for parents as well  to get updated about the career opportunities open for their children. 
                 <br>
                  To all our students, with the hope that this will help them capture their dreams by picking the right choices

          <h1>Librarian</h1>
          <p>
            As the librarian, I am excited to offer our students a space where they can not only find books but also ignite their curiosity and imagination. The library is more than just a place to check out books—it's a hub for learning, discovery, and creativity. Here, students have access to a wide range of resources, from textbooks and reference materials to fiction, non-fiction, and digital media.</p>
          <p>
            Our goal is to support the academic growth of every student by fostering a love for reading and helping them develop strong research and information literacy skills. Whether you’re looking for the perfect novel, researching a project, or simply seeking a quiet place to study, the library is here to help.
          </p>
          <p>
            I encourage students to explore the many resources available, participate in reading programs, and take advantage of library workshops designed to enhance their skills. Together, let’s make reading an adventure that supports both learning and personal growth!
